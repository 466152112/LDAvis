# R package for interactive topic model visualization using shiny & D3

## Installing the package

Currently there isn't a release on [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/).

You can, however, decompress the zip ball or tar ball and run `R CMD INSTALL` on it or use `library(devtools); install("/path/to/package")`.

## Using the package

Once installed, load `library(LDAvis)`. See the help page `?runVis` for examples and details on how to create your own visualization.
